# Movie Recommender System


## Objective
Develop a system to predict user ratings for movies using both content-based and collaborative filtering methods.

## Project Description
This project involved building a hybrid recommender system that leverages user and movie data to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system combines content-based filtering using movie features and collaborative filtering using user interactions to improve recommendation accuracy.

## Key Achievements
- **Implemented content-based filtering:** Utilized TF-IDF Vectorizer and cosine similarity to recommend movies based on their content features such as genres and tags.
- **Applied collaborative filtering:** Used matrix factorization techniques to predict user ratings based on past interactions with movies.
- **Optimized model performance:** Fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve high prediction accuracy and improve user engagement.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics like RMSE, ensuring the system delivers relevant and accurate recommendations.
